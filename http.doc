\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:http-intro}

The HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the W3C standard protocol for
transferring information between a web-client (e.g., a browser) and a
web-server. The protocol is a simple \emph{envelope} protocol where
standard name/value pairs in the header are used to split the stream
into messages and communicate about the connection-status. Many
languages have client and or server libraries to deal with the HTTP
protocol, making it a suitable candidate for general purpose
client-server applications.

In this document we describe a modular infra-structure to access
web-servers from SWI-Prolog and turn Prolog into a web-server.

\section{The HTTP client libraries}
\label{sec:http-clients}

This package provides two client libraries for accessing HTTP servers.
The first, \pllib{http/http_open} is a library for opening a HTTP URL
address as a Prolog stream. The general skeleton for using this library
is given below, where \nopredref{process}{1} processes the data from the
HTTP server.\footnote{One may opt to use cleanup/2 intead of
setup_call_cleanup/3 to allow for aborting while http_open/3 is waiting
for the connection.}

\begin{code}
    setup_call_cleanup(
	http_open(URL, In, []),
	process(In),
	close(In)).
\end{code}

The second, \pllib{http/http_client} provides http_get/3 and
http_post/4, both of which process the reply using plugins to convert
the data based on the \texttt{Content-Type} of the reply.  This library
supports a plugin infrastructure that can register hooks for converting
additional document types.

\paragraph{Status}

Starting with version 7.3.11, \pllib{http/http_client} is based on
\pllib{http/http_open}. Before that, \pllib{http/http_client} managed
keep-alive connections. This functionality is now provided by
http_open/3. The hooks for controlling keep-alive have been removed from
\pllib{http/http_client}. The new implementation of keep-alive handling
is part of \pllib{http/http_open}. Whether or not keep-alive is used can
be controlled with the connection('Keep-alive') option or the
http:open_options/2 hook.

\input{httpopen.tex}
\input{httpclient.tex}

\section{The HTTP server libraries}		\label{sec:httpserver}

The HTTP server library consists of two obligatory parts and one
optional part. The first deals with connection management and has three
different implementation depending on the desired type of server. The
second implements a generic wrapper for decoding the HTTP request,
calling user code to handle the request and encode the answer. The
optional \file{http_dispatch} module can be used to assign HTTP
\jargon{locations} (paths) to predicates. This design is summarised in
\figref{httpserver}.

\postscriptfig[width=0.8\linewidth]{httpserver}{Design of the HTTP
server}

In practice, library(http/thread_httpd) is the most versatile,
performant and stable version of the server type implementations. A
typical skeleton for building a server is given below, where
\nopredref{server}{1} creates a number of Prolog \jargon{threads}
that handle the HTTP requests.  The \nopredref{server}{1} predicate
itself succeeds as soon as the server is initialized.

\begin{code}
:- use_module(library(http/thread_httpd)).
:- use_module(library(http/http_dispatch)).

server(Port) :-
        http_server(http_dispatch,
                    [ port(Port)
                    ]).

:- http_handler(root(.), entry_page, []).
:- http_handler(root(home), home_page, []).
...

entry_page(Request) :-
	...	% writes reply as CGI document
\end{code}

The functional body of the user's code is independent from the selected
server-type, making it easy to switch between the supported server
types.


\subsection{The `Body'}				\label{sec:body}

The server-body is the code that handles the request and formulates a
reply. To facilitate all mentioned setups, the body is driven by
http_wrapper/5. The goal is called with the parsed request (see
\secref{request}) as argument and \const{current_output} set to a
temporary buffer. Its task is closely related to the task of a CGI
script; it must write a header declaring holding at least the
\const{Content-type} field and a body. Here is a simple body writing the
request as an HTML table.

\begin{code}
reply(Request) :-
	format('Content-type: text/html~n~n', []),
	format('<html>~n', []),
	format('<table border=1>~n'),
	print_request(Request),
	format('~n</table>~n'),
	format('</html>~n', []).

print_request([]).
print_request([H|T]) :-
	H =.. [Name, Value],
	format('<tr><td>~w<td>~w~n', [Name, Value]),
	print_request(T).
\end{code}

The infrastructure recognises the header fields described below. Other
header lines are passed verbatim to the client. Typical examples are
\texttt{Set-Cookie} and authentication headers (see \secref{httpauthenticate}).

\begin{description}
    \item[Content-type:~\arg{Type}]
This field is passed to the client and used by the infrastructure to
determine the \jargon{encoding} to use for the stream. If \arg{type}
matches \const{text/*} or the type matches with \const{UTF-8} (case
insensitive), the server uses UTF-8 encoding. The user may force UTF-8
encoding for arbitrary content types by adding \texttt{; charset=UTF-8}
to the end of the \const{Content-type} header.

    \item[Transfer-encoding:~chunked]
Causes the server to use \jargon{chunked} encoding
if the client allows for it. See also \secref{transfer} and the
\const{chunked} option in http_handler/3.

    \item[Connection:~close]
Causes the connection to be closed after the transfer.  The default is
to keep it open `Keep-Alive' if possible.

    \item[Location:~\arg{URL}]
This header may be combined with the \const{Status} header to force a
\jargon{redirect} response to the given \arg{URL}.  The message body
must be empty. Handling this header is primarily intended for
compatibility with the CGI conventions. Prolog code should use
http_redirect/3.

    \item[Status:~\arg{Status}]
This header can be combined with \const{Location}, where \arg{Status}
must be one of 301 (moved), 302 (moved temporary, default) or 303 (see
other).
\end{description}



\subsubsection{Returning special status codes}	\label{sec:httpspecials}

Besides returning a page by writing it to the current output stream,
the server goal can raise an exception using throw/1 to generate special
pages such as \const{not_found}, \const{moved}, etc. The defined
exceptions are:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{http_reply}{+Reply, +HdrExtra}
Return a result page using http_reply/3.  See http_reply/3 for details.

    \termitem{http_reply}{+Reply}
Equivalent to \term{http_reply}{Reply, []}.

    \termitem{http}{not_modified}
Equivalent to \term{http_reply}{not_modified, []}.  This exception is
for backward compatibility and can be used by the server to indicate
the referenced resource has not been modified since it was requested
last time.
\end{description}

In addition, the normal \verb$"200 OK"$ reply status may be overruled by
writing a CGI \const{Status} header prior to the remainder of the
message. This is particularly useful for defining REST APIs. The
following handler replies with a \verb$"201 Created"$ header:

\begin{code}
handle_request(Request) :-
	process_data(Request, Id),	% application predicate
	format('Status: 201~n'),
	format('Content-type: text/plain~n~n'),
	format('Created object as ~q~n', [Id]).
\end{code}


\input{httpdispatch.tex}
\input{httpdirindex.tex}
\input{httpfiles.tex}
\input{httpsession.tex}
\input{httpcors.tex}
\input{httpauthenticate.tex}

\subsection{Custom Error Pages}
\label{sec:http-custom-error-page}

It is possible to create arbitrary error pages for responses generated
when a http_reply term is thrown. Currently this is only supported for
status 403 (\textit{authentication required}). To do this, instead of
throwing \term{http_reply}{authorise(Term)} throw
\term{http_reply}{authorise(Term), [], Key}, where \arg{Key} is an
arbitrary term relating to the page you want to generate. You must then
also define a clause of the multifile predicate http:status_page_hook/3:

\begin{description}
    \predicate{http:status_page_hook}{3}{+StatusCode, +Key, -CustomHTML}
StatusCode is the page status code (such as 401), Key is the third
argument of the http_reply exception which was thrown, and CustomHTML is
a list of HTML tokens. The default page for 401 is generated via this
code:

\begin{code}
        phrase(page([ title('401 Authorization Required')
		    ],
		    [ h1('Authorization Required'),
		      p(['This server could not verify that you ',
			 'are authorized to access the document ',
			 'requested.  Either you supplied the wrong ',
			 'credentials (e.g., bad password), or your ',
			 'browser doesn\'t understand how to supply ',
			 'the credentials required.'
			]),
		      \address
		    ]),
	       CustomHTML).
\end{code}
\end{description}


\input{httpopenid.tex}

%================================================================
\subsection{Get parameters from HTML forms}
\label{sec:httpparam}

The library \pllib{http/http_parameters} provides two predicates to
fetch HTTP request parameters as a type-checked list easily.  The
library transparently handles both GET and POST requests.  It builds
on top of the low-level request representation described in
\secref{request}.

\begin{description}
    \predicate{http_parameters}{2}{+Request, ?Parameters}
The predicate is passes the \arg{Request} as provided to the handler
goal by http_wrapper/5 as well as a partially instantiated lists
describing the requested parameters and their types. Each parameter
specification in \arg{Parameters} is a term of the format
\mbox{\arg{Name}(\arg{-Value}, \arg{+Options})}. \arg{Options} is a list
of option terms describing the type, default, etc. If no options are
specified the parameter must be present and its value is returned in
\arg{Value} as an atom.

If a parameter is missing the exception
\term{error}{\term{existence_error}{http_parameter, Name}, _} is thrown
which. If the argument cannot be converted to the requested type, a
\term{error}{\term{existence_error}{Type, Value}, _} is raised, where
the error context indicates the HTTP parameter. If not caught, the
server translates both errors into a \texttt{400 Bad request} HTTP
message.

Options fall into three categories: those that handle presence of
the parameter, those that guide conversion and restrict types and
those that support automatic generation of documention.  First,
the presence-options:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{default}{Default}
If the named parameter is missing, \arg{Value} is unified to
\arg{Default}.

    \termitem{optional}{true}
If the named parameter is missing, \arg{Value} is left unbound and
no error is generated.

    \termitem{list}{Type}
The same parameter may not appear or appear multiple times. If this
option is present, \const{default} and \const{optional} are ignored and
the value is returned as a list. Type checking options are processed on
each value.

    \termitem{zero_or_more}{}
Deprecated.  Use \term{list}{Type}.
\end{description}

The type and conversion options are given below. The type-language can
be extended by providing clauses for the multifile hook
http:convert_parameter/3.

\begin{description}
    \termitem{;}{Type1, Type2}
Succeed if either \arg{Type1} or \arg{Type2} applies.  It allows
for checks such as \exam{(nonneg;oneof([infinite]))} to specify
an integer or a symbolic value.

    \termitem{oneof}{List}
Succeeds if the value is member of the given list.

    \definition{length $> N$}
Succeeds if value is an atom of more than $N$ characters.

    \definition{length $>= N$}
Succeeds if value is an atom of more or than equal to $N$ characters.

    \definition{length $< N$}
Succeeds if value is an atom of less than $N$ characters.

    \definition{length $=< N$}
Succeeds if value is an atom of length than or equal to $N$ characters.

    \termitem{atom}{}
No-op.  Allowed for consistency.

    \termitem{string}{}
Convert value to a string.

    \termitem{between}{+Low, +High}
Convert value to a number and if either \arg{Low} or \arg{High} is a
float, force value to be a float.  Then check that the value is in the
given range, which includes the boundaries.

    \termitem{boolean}{}
Translate =true=, =yes=, =on= and '1' into =true=; =false=, =no=,
=off= and '0' into =false= and raises an error otherwise.

    \termitem{float}{}
Convert value to a float. Integers are transformed into float.  Throws a
type-error otherwise.

    \termitem{integer}{}
Convert value to an integer.  Throws a type-error otherwise.

    \termitem{nonneg}{}
Convert value to a non-negative integer. Throws a type-error
of the value cannot be converted to an integer and a domain-error
otherwise.

    \termitem{number}{}
Convert value to a number.  Throws a type-error otherwise.
\end{description}

The last set of options is to support automatic generation of HTTP
API documentation from the sources.\footnote{This facility is under
development in ClioPatria; see \file{http_help.pl}}.

\begin{description}
    \termitem{description}{+Atom}
Description of the parameter in plain text.

    \termitem{group}{+Parameters, +Options}
Define a logical group of parameters.  \arg{Parameters} are processed
as normal. \arg{Options} may include a description of the group. Groups
can be nested.
\end{description}

Below is an example

\begin{code}
reply(Request) :-
	http_parameters(Request,
			[ title(Title, [ optional(true) ]),
			  name(Name,   [ length >= 2 ]),
			  age(Age,     [ between(0, 150) ])
			]),
	...
\end{code}

Same as \term{http_parameters}{Request, Parameters, []}

    \predicate{http_parameters}{3}{+Request, ?Parameters, +Options}
In addition to http_parameters/2, the following options are defined.

\begin{description}
    \termitem{form_data}{-Data}
Return the entire set of provided \arg{Name}=\arg{Value} pairs from
the GET or POST request.  All values are returned as atoms.

    \termitem{attribute_declarations}{:Goal}
If a parameter specification lacks the parameter options, call
\term{call}{Goal, +ParamName, -Options} to find the options.  Intended
to share declarations over many calls to http_parameters/3. Using
this construct the above can be written as below.

\begin{code}
reply(Request) :-
	http_parameters(Request,
			[ title(Title),
			  name(Name),
			  age(Age)
			],
			[ attribute_declarations(param)
			]),
	...

param(title, [optional(true)]).
param(name,  [length >= 2 ]).
param(age,   [integer]).
\end{code}
\end{description}
\end{description}


\subsection{Request format}			\label{sec:request}

The body-code (see \secref{body}) is driven by a \arg{Request}.  This
request is generated from http_read_request/2 defined in
\pllib{http/http_header}.


\begin{description}
    \predicate{http_read_request}{2}{+Stream, -Request}
Reads an HTTP request from \arg{Stream} and unify \arg{Request} with
the parsed request.  \arg{Request} is a list of \term{\arg{Name}}{Value}
elements.  It provides a number of predefined elements for the result
of parsing the first line of the request, followed by the additional
request parameters.  The predefined fields are:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{host}{Host}
If the request contains \verb$Host: $\arg{Host}, Host is unified
with the host-name.  If \arg{Host} is of the format <host>:<port>
\arg{Host} only describes <host> and a field \term{port}{Port} where
\arg{Port} is an integer is added.

    \termitem{input}{Stream}
The \arg{Stream} is passed along, allowing to read more data or
requests from the same stream.  This field is always present.

    \termitem{method}{Method}
\arg{Method} is the HTTP \jargon{method} represented as a lower-case
atom, e.g., \const{get}, \const{put}, \const{post}. This
field is present if the header has been parsed successfully.

    \termitem{path}{Path}
Path associated to the request.  This field is always present.

    \termitem{peer}{Peer}
\arg{Peer} is a term \term{ip}{A,B,C,D} containing the IP address of
the contacting host.

    \termitem{port}{Port}
Port requested.  See \const{host} for details.

    \termitem{request_uri}{RequestURI}
This is the untranslated string that follows the method in the
request header.  It is used to construct the path and search fields
of the \arg{Request}.  It is provided because reconstructing this
string from the path and search fields may yield a different value
due to different usage of percent encoding.

    \termitem{search}{ListOfNameValue}
Search-specification of URI. This is the part after the \chr{?},
normally used to transfer data from HTML forms that use the
`\const{GET}' protocol. In the URL it consists of a www-form-encoded
list of \arg{Name}=\arg{Value} pairs.  This is mapped to a list of
Prolog \arg{Name}=\arg{Value} terms with decoded names and values.
This field is only present if the location contains a
search-specification.

The URL specification does not \emph{demand} the query part to be
of the form \textit{name=value}.  If the field is syntactically
incorrect, ListOfNameValue is bound the the empty list ([]).

    \termitem{http_version}{Major-Minor}
If the first line contains the \const{HTTP/}\arg{Major}.\arg{Minor}
version indicator this element indicate the HTTP version of the
peer.  Otherwise this field is not present.

    \termitem{cookie}{ListOfNameValue}
If the header contains a \const{Cookie} line, the value of the
cookie is broken down in \arg{Name}=\arg{Value} pairs, where the
\arg{Name} is the lowercase version of the cookie name as used
for the HTTP fields.

    \termitem{set_cookie}{set_cookie(Name, Value, Options)}
If the header contains a \const{SetCookie} line, the cookie field
is broken down into the \arg{Name} of the cookie, the \arg{Value}
and a list of \arg{Name}=\arg{Value} pairs for additional options
such as \const{expire}, \const{path}, \const{domain} or \const{secure}.
\end{description}

If the first line of the request is tagged with
\const{HTTP/}\arg{Major}.\arg{Minor}, http_read_request/2 reads all
input upto the first blank line. This header consists of
\arg{Name}:\arg{Value} fields.  Each such field appears as a term
\term{\arg{Name}}{Value} in the \arg{Request}, where \arg{Name} is
canonicalised for use with Prolog.  Canonisation implies that the
\arg{Name} is converted to lower case and all occurrences of the
\chr{-} are replaced by \chr{_}. The value for the
\const{Content-length} fields is translated into an integer.
\end{description}

Here is an example:

\begin{code}
?- http_read_request(user_input, X).
|: GET /mydb?class=person HTTP/1.0
|: Host: gollem
|:
X = [ input(user),
      method(get),
      search([ class = person
	     ]),
      path('/mydb'),
      http_version(1-0),
      host(gollem)
    ].
\end{code}


\subsubsection{Handling POST requests}
\label{sec:http-read-post}

Where the HTTP \const{GET} operation is intended to get a document,
using a \arg{path} and possibly some additional search information,
the \const{POST} operation is intended to hand potentially large
amounts of data to the server for processing.

The \arg{Request} parameter above contains the term \term{method}{post}.
The data posted is left on the input stream that is available through
the term \term{input}{Stream} from the \arg{Request} header. This data
can be read using http_read_data/3 from the HTTP client library. Here is
a demo implementation simply returning the parsed posted data as plain
text (assuming pp/1 pretty-prints the data).

\begin{code}
reply(Request) :-
	member(method(post), Request), !,
	http_read_data(Request, Data, []),
	format('Content-type: text/plain~n~n', []),
	pp(Data).
\end{code}

If the POST is initiated from a browser, content-type is generally
either \const{application/x-www-form-urlencoded} or
\const{multipart/form-data}.  The latter is broken down automatically
if the plug-in \pllib{http/http_mime_plugin} is loaded.


\subsection{Running the server}
\label{sec:http-running-server}

The functionality of the server should be defined in one Prolog file (of
course this file is allowed to load other files). Depending on the
wanted server setup this `body' is wrapped into a small Prolog file
combining the body with the appropriate server interface. There are
three supported server-setups. For most applications we advice the
multi-threaded server. Examples of this server architecture are the
\url[PlDoc]{http://www.swi-prolog.org/packages/pldoc.html} documentation
system and the \url[SeRQL]{http://www.swi-prolog.org/packages/SeRQL/}
Semantic Web server infrastructure.

All the server setups may be wrapped in a \jargon{reverse proxy} to
make them available from the public web-server as described in
\secref{proxy}.


\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Using \pllib{thread_httpd} for a multi-threaded server]
This server exploits the multi-threaded version of SWI-Prolog, running
the users body code parallel from a pool of worker threads. As it avoids
the state engine and copying required in the event-driven server it is
generally faster and capable to handle multiple requests concurrently.

This server is harder to debug due to the involved threading, although
the GUI tracer provides reasonable support for multi-threaded
applications using the tspy/1 command. It can provide fast communication
to multiple clients and can be used for more demanding servers.

    \item [Using \pllib{inetd_httpd} for server-per-client]
In this setup the Unix \program{inetd} user-daemon is used to initialise
a server for each connection.  This approach is especially suitable for
servers that have a limited startup-time.  In this setup a crashing
client does not influence other requests.

This server is very hard to debug as the server is not connected to the
user environment.  It provides a robust implementation for servers that
can be started quickly.
\end{itemlist}


\subsubsection{Common server interface options}
\label{sec:http-server-options}

All the server interfaces provide \term{http_server}{:Goal, +Options}
to create the server.  The list of options differ, but the servers share
common options:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{port}{?Port}
Specify the port to listen to for stand-alone servers.  \arg{Port} is
either an integer or unbound.  If unbound, it is unified to the selected
free port.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Multi-threaded Prolog}		\label{sec:mthttpd}

The \pllib{http/thread_httpd.pl} provides the infrastructure to manage
multiple clients using a pool of \jargon{worker-threads}.  This realises
a popular server design, also seen in Java Tomcat and Microsoft .NET.
As a single persistent server process maintains communication to all
clients startup time is not an important issue and the server can
easily maintain state-information for all clients.

In addition to the functionality provided by the inetd server, the
threaded server can also be used to realise an HTTPS server exploiting
the \pllib{ssl} library. See option \term{ssl}{+SSLOptions} below.


\begin{description}
    \predicate{http_server}{3}{:Goal, +Options}
Create the server. \arg{Options} must provide the \term{port}{?Port}
option to specify the port the server should listen to. If \arg{Port} is
unbound an arbitrary free port is selected and \arg{Port} is unified to
this port-number.  The server consists of a small Prolog thread
accepting new connection on \arg{Port} and dispatching these to a pool
of workers.  Defined \arg{Options} are:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{port}{?Address}
Address to bind to. \arg{Address} is either a port (integer) or a term
\arg{Host}:\arg{Port}. The port may be a variable, causing the system to
select a free port and unify the variable with the selected port. See
also tcp_bind/2.

    \termitem{workers}{+N}
Defines the number of worker threads in the pool. Default is to use
\arg{two} workers. Choosing the optimal value for best performance is a
difficult task depending on the number of CPUs in your system and how
much resources are required for processing a request. Too high numbers
makes your system switch too often between threads or even swap if there
is not enough memory to keep all threads in memory, while a too low
number causes clients to wait unnecessary for other clients to complete.
See also http_workers/2.

    \termitem{timeout}{+SecondsOrInfinite}
Determines the maximum period of inactivity handling a request.  If no
data arrives within the specified time since the last data arrived the
connection raises an exception, the worker discards the client and
returns to the pool-queue for a new client. Default is \const{infinite},
making each worker wait forever for a request to complete.  Without a
timeout, a worker may wait forever on an a client that doesn't complete
its request.

    \termitem{keep_alive_timeout}{+SecondsOrInfinite}
Maximum time to wait for new activity on \emph{Keep-Alive} connections.
Choosing the correct value for this parameter is hard. Disabling
Keep-Alive is bad for performance if the clients request multiple
documents for a single page. This may ---for example-- be caused by HTML
frames, HTML pages with images, associated CSS files, etc.  Keeping
a connection open in the threaded model however prevents the thread
servicing the client servicing other clients.  The default is 5 seconds.

    \termitem{local}{+KBytes}
Size of the local-stack for the workers. Default is taken from the
commandline option.

    \termitem{global}{+KBytes}
Size of the global-stack for the workers. Default is taken from the
commandline option.

    \termitem{trail}{+KBytes}
Size of the trail-stack for the workers. Default is taken from the
commandline option.

    \termitem{ssl}{+SSLOptions}
Use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) rather than plan TCP/IP. A server created
this way is accessed using the \const{https://} protocol. SSL allows for
encrypted communication to avoid others from tapping the wire as well as
improved authentication of client and server. The \arg{SSLOptions}
option list is passed to ssl_init/3. The port option of the main option
list is forwarded to the SSL layer. See the \pllib{ssl} library for
details.
\end{description}

    \predicate{http_server_property}{2}{?Port, ?Property}
True if \arg{Property} is a property of the HTTP server running at
\arg{Port}.  Defined properties are:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{goal}{:Goal}
Goal used to start the server. This is often http_dispatch/1.
    \termitem{start_time}{?Time}
Time-stamp when the server was created.  See format_time/3 for
creating a human-readable representation.
\end{description}

    \predicate{http_workers}{2}{+Port, ?Workers}
Query or manipulate the number of workers of the server identified by
\arg{Port}.  If \arg{Workers} is unbound it is unified with the number
of running servers.  If it is an integer greater than the current size
of the worker pool new workers are created with the same specification
as the running workers.  If the number is less than the current size
of the worker pool, this predicate inserts a number of `quit' requests
in the queue, discarding the excess workers as they finish their jobs
(i.e.\ no worker is abandoned while serving a client).

This can be used to tune the number of workers for performance.  Another
possible application is to reduce the pool to one worker to facilitate
easier debugging.

    \predicate{http_add_worker}{2}{+Port, +Options}
Add a new worker to the HTTP server for port \arg{Port}. \arg{Options}
overrule the default queue options. The following additional options are
processed:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{max_idle_time}{+Seconds}
The created worker will automatically terminate if there is no new work
within Seconds.
\end{description}

    \predicate{http_stop_server}{2}{+Port, +Options}
Stop the HTTP server at Port. Halting a server is done
\textit{gracefully}, which means that requests being processed are not
abandoned. The \arg{Options} list is for future refinements of this
predicate such as a forced immediate abort of the server, but is
currently ignored.

    \predicate{http_current_worker}{2}{?Port, ?ThreadID}
True if \arg{ThreadID} is the identifier of a Prolog thread serving
\arg{Port}. This predicate is motivated to allow for the use of
arbitrary interaction with the worker thread for development and
statistics.

    \predicate{http_spawn}{2}{:Goal, +Spec}
Continue handling this request in a new thread running \arg{Goal}. After
http_spawn/2, the worker returns to the pool to process new requests. In
its simplest form, \arg{Spec} is the name of a thread pool as defined by
thread_pool_create/3. Alternatively it is an option list, whose options
are passed to thread_create_in_pool/4 if \arg{Spec} contains
\term{pool}{Pool} or to thread_create/3 of the pool option is not
present. If the dispatch module is used (see \secref{httpdispatch}),
spawning is normally specified as an option to the http_handler/3
registration.

We recomment the use of thread pools. They allow registration of a set
of threads using common characteristics, specify how many can be active
and what to do if all threads are active. A typical application may
define a small pool of threads with large stacks for computation
intensive tasks, and a large pool of threads with small stacks to serve
media. The declaration could be the one below, allowing for max 3
concurrent solvers and a maximum backlog of 5 and 30 tasks creating
image thumbnails.

\begin{code}
:- use_module(library(thread_pool)).

:- thread_pool_create(compute, 3,
		      [ local(20000), global(100000), trail(50000),
			backlog(5)
		      ]).
:- thread_pool_create(media, 30,
		      [ local(100), global(100), trail(100),
			backlog(100)
		      ]).

:- http_handler('/solve',     solve,     [spawn(compute)]).
:- http_handler('/thumbnail', thumbnail, [spawn(media)]).
\end{code}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{From (Unix) inetd}
\label{sec:http-inetd}

All modern Unix systems handle a large number of the services they run
through the super-server \emph{inetd}. This program reads
\file{/etc/inetd.conf} and opens server-sockets on all ports defined in
this file. As a request comes in it accepts it and starts the associated
server such that standard I/O refers to the socket. This approach has
several advantages:

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Simplification of servers]
Servers don't have to know about sockets and -operations.

    \item [Centralised authorisation]
Using \emph{tcpwrappers} simple and effective firewalling of all
services is realised.

    \item [Automatic start and monitor]
The inetd automatically starts the server `just-in-time' and starts
additional servers or restarts a crashed server according to the
specifications.
\end{itemlist}

The very small generic script for handling inetd based connections
is in \file{inetd_httpd}, defining http_server/1:

\begin{description}
    \predicate{http_server}{2}{:Goal, +Options}
Initialises and runs http_wrapper/5 in a loop until failure or
end-of-file.  This server does not support the \arg{Port} option
as the port is specified with the \program{inetd} configuration.
The only supported option is \arg{After}.
\end{description}

Here is the example from \file{demo_inetd}

\begin{code}
#!/usr/bin/pl -t main -q -f
:- use_module(demo_body).
:- use_module(inetd_httpd).

main :-
	http_server(reply).
\end{code}

With the above file installed in \file{/home/jan/plhttp/demo_inetd},
the following line in \file{/etc/inetd} enables the server at port
4001 guarded by \emph{tcpwrappers}.  After modifying inetd, send the
daemon the \const{HUP} signal to make it reload its configuration.
For more information, please check \manref{inetd.conf}{5}.

\begin{code}
4001 stream tcp nowait nobody /usr/sbin/tcpd /home/jan/plhttp/demo_inetd
\end{code}


\subsubsection{MS-Windows}
\label{sec:http-inetd-mswin}

There are rumours that \emph{inetd} has been ported to Windows.


\subsubsection{As CGI script}
\label{sec:http-server-as-cgi}

To be done.


\subsubsection{Using a reverse proxy}
\label{sec:proxy}

There are several options for public deployment of a web service. The
main decision is whether to run it on a standard port (port 80 for HTTP,
port 443 for HTTPS) or a non-standard port such as for example 8000 or
8080. Using a standard port below 1000 requires root access to the
machine, and prevents other web services from using the same port. On
the other hand, using a non-stardard port may cause problems with
intermediate proxy- and/or firewall policies that may block the port
on your end when you try to access the service. In both cases, you can
either use a physical or a virtual virtual machine running ---for
example--- under \url[VMWARE]{http://www.vmware.com} or
\url[XEN]{http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/xen/} to host the
service. The (virtual) machine approach isolates security threats.
Isolation can be achieved using a Unix \jargon{chroot} environment,
which is however not a security feature.

To make several different web services reachable on the same (either
standard or non-standard) port, you can use a so-called
\jargon{reverse proxy}. This causes the main web server to relay
requests below a given URL location to different web servers that
use their own dedicated ports. This approach has several advantages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We can run the service on a non-standard port, but still access
	  it (via the proxy) on a standard port, just as for a dedicated
	  machine. We do not need a separate machine though:
	  We only need to configure the reverse proxy to relay requests
	  to the intended target servers.
    \item As the main web server is doing the front-line service, the
	  Prolog server is normally protected from malformed HTTP requests
	  that could result in denial of service or otherwise compromise the
	  server. In addition, the main web server can transparently provide
	  encodings such as compression to the outside world.
\end{itemize}

Note that the proxy technology can be combined with isolation methods
such as dedicated machines, virtual machines and chroot jails.  The
proxy can also provide load balancing.

\paragraph{Setting up an Apache reverse proxy}

The Apache reverse proxy setup is really simple. Ensure the modules
\const{proxy} and \const{proxy_http} are loaded. Then add two simple
rules to the server configuration. Below is an example that makes a
PlDoc server on port 4000 available from the main Apache server at port
80.

\begin{code}
ProxyPass	 /pldoc/ http://localhost:4000/pldoc/
ProxyPassReverse /pldoc/ http://localhost:4000/pldoc/
\end{code}

Apache rewrites the HTTP headers passing by, but using the above rules
it does not examine the content. This implies that URLs embedded in the
(HTML) content must use relative addressing.  If the locations on the
public and Prolog server are the same (as in the example above) it is
allowed to use absolute locations.  I.e.\ \const{/pldoc/search} is ok,
but \const{http://myhost.com:4000/pldoc/search} is \emph{not}.  If
the locations on the server differ, locations must be relative (i.e.\
not start with \chr{/}.

This problem can also be solved using the contributed Apache module
\const{proxy_html} that can be instructed to rewrite URLs embedded in
HTML documents. In our experience, this is not troublefree as URLs can
appear in many places in generated documents.  JavaScript can create
URLs on the fly, which makes rewriting virtually impossible.

\subsection{The wrapper library}
\label{sec:http-wrapper}

The body is called by the module \pllib{http/http_wrapper.pl}. This
module realises the communication between the I/O streams and the body
described in \secref{body}. The interface is realised by
http_wrapper/5:

\begin{description}
    \predicate{http_wrapper}{5}{:Goal, +In, +Out, -Connection, +Options}
Handle an HTTP request where \arg{In} is an input stream from the
client, \arg{Out} is an output stream to the client and \arg{Goal}
defines the goal realising the body.  \arg{Connection} is unified to
\const{'Keep-alive'} if both ends of the connection want to continue the
connection or \const{close} if either side wishes to close the
connection.

This predicate reads an HTTP request-header from \arg{In}, redirects
current output to a memory file and then runs \exam{call(Goal,
Request)}, watching for exceptions and failure. If \arg{Goal} executes
successfully it generates a complete reply from the created output.
Otherwise it generates an HTTP server error with additional context
information derived from the exception.

http_wrapper/5 supports the following options:

\begin{description}
    \termitem{request}{-Request}
Return the executed request to the caller.

    \termitem{peer}{+Peer}
Add peer(Peer) to the request header handed to \arg{Goal}.  The format
of \arg{Peer} is defined by tcp_accept/3 from the clib package.
\end{description}

    \predicate{http:request_expansion}{2}{+RequestIn, -RequestOut}
This \jargon{multifile} hook predicate is called just before the goal
that produces the body, while the output is already redirected to
collect the reply. If it succeeds it must return a valid modified
request. It is allowed to throw exceptions as defined in
\secref{httpspecials}. It is intended for operations such as mapping
paths, deny access for certain requests or manage cookies. If it writes
output, these must be HTTP header fields that are added \emph{before}
header fields written by the body. The example below is from the
session management library (see \secref{httpsession}) sets a cookie.

\begin{code}
	...,
	format('Set-Cookie: ~w=~w; path=~w~n', [Cookie, SessionID, Path]),
	...,
\end{code}

    \predicate{http_current_request}{1}{-Request}
Get access to the currently executing request.  \arg{Request} is the
same as handed to \arg{Goal} of http_wrapper/5 \emph{after} applying
rewrite rules as defined by http:request_expansion/2. Raises an
existence error if there is no request in progress.

    \predicate{http_relative_path}{2}{+AbsPath, -RelPath}
Convert an absolute path (without host, fragment or search) into a path
relative to the current page, defined as the path component from the
current request (see http_current_request/1). This call is intended to
create reusable components returning relative paths for easier support
of reverse proxies.

If ---for whatever reason--- the conversion is not possible it simply
unifies \arg{RelPath} to \arg{AbsPath}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Debugging HTTP servers}			\label{sec:http-debug}

The library \pllib{http/http_error} defines a hook that decorates
uncaught exceptions with a stack-trace. This will generate a \emph{500
internal server error} document with a stack-trace. To enable this
feature, simply load this library.  Please do note that providing
error information to the user simplifies the job of a hacker trying
to compromise your server.  It is therefore not recommended to load
this file by default.

The example program \file{calc.pl} has the error handler loaded which
can be triggered by forcing a divide-by-zero in the calculator.

\input{httpheader}

\subsection{The \pllib{http/html_write} library}	\label{sec:htmlwrite}

\newcommand{\elem}[1]{\const{#1}}

Producing output for the web in the form of an HTML document is a
requirement for many Prolog programs. Just using format/2 is
not satisfactory as it leads to poorly readable programs generating poor
HTML. This library is based on using DCG rules.

The \pllib{http/html_write} structures the generation of HTML from a
program. It is an extensible library, providing a \jargon{DCG} framework
for generating legal HTML under (Prolog) program control. It is
especially useful for the generation of structured pages (e.g.\ tables)
from Prolog data structures.

The normal way to use this library is through the DCG html//1. This
non-terminal provides the central translation from a structured term
with embedded calls to additional translation rules to a list of atoms
that can then be printed using print_html/[1,2].

\begin{description}
    \dcg{html}{1}{:Spec}
The DCG non-terminal html//1 is the main predicate of this library. It translates
the specification for an HTML page into a list of atoms that can be
written to a stream using print_html/[1,2]. The expansion rules of this
predicate may be extended by defining the multifile DCG
html_write:expand//1. \arg{Spec} is either a single specification or a
list of single specifications. Using nested lists is not allowed to
avoid ambiguity caused by the atom \const{[]}

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Atomic data]
Atomic data is quoted using html_quoted//1.

    \item [\arg{Fmt} - \arg{Args}]
\arg{Fmt} and \arg{Args} are used as format-specification and argument
list to format/3. The result is quoted and added to the output list.

    \item [\bsl\arg{List}]
Escape sequence to add atoms directly to the output list.  This can be
used to embed external HTML code or emit script output.  \arg{List} is
a list of the following terms:

    \begin{itemlist}
	\item [\arg{Fmt} - \arg{Args}]
    \arg{Fmt} and \arg{Args} are used as format-specification and argument
    list to format/3. The result is added to the output list.
	\item [\arg{Atomic}]
    Atomic values are added directly to the output list.
    \end{itemlist}

    \item [\bsl\arg{Term}]
Invoke the non-terminal \arg{Term} in the calling module.  This is the
common mechanism to realise abstraction and modularisation in generating
HTML.

    \item [\arg{Module}:\arg{Term}]
Invoke the non-terminal <Module>:<Term>. This is similar to
\bsl\arg{Term} but allows for invoking grammar rules in external
packages.

    \item [\&(Entity)]
Emit {\tt\&<Entity>;} or {\tt\&\#<Entity>;} if \arg{Entity} is an
integer. SWI-Prolog atoms and strings are represented as Unicode.
Explicit use of this construct is rarely needed because code-points that
are not supported by the output encoding are automatically converted
into character-entities.

    \item [\term{Tag}{Content}]
Emit HTML element \arg{Tag} using \arg{Content} and no attributes.
\arg{Content} is handed to html//1. See \secref{htmllayout} for details
on the automatically generated layout.

    \item [\term{Tag}{Attributes, Content}]
Emit HTML element \arg{Tag} using \arg{Attributes} and \arg{Content}.
\arg{Attributes} is either a single attribute of a list of attributes.
Each attributes is of the format \term{Name}{Value} or
\mbox{\arg{Name}=\arg{Value}}. \arg{Value} is the atomic attribute
value but allows for a limited functional notation:

    \begin{itemlist}
	\item [$A$ + $B$]
Concatenation of $A$ and $B$
	\item [$Format$-$Arguments$]
Use format/3 and emit the result as quoted value.
	\item [\term{encode}{Atom}]
Use uri_encoded/3 to create a valid URL query component.
	\item [\term{location_by_id}{ID}]
HTTP location of the HTTP handler with given ID.  See http_location_by_id/2.
	\item [$A$ + \arg{List}]
\arg{List} is handled as a URL `search' component. The list members are
terms of the format \mbox{\arg{Name} = \arg{Value}} or
\term{Name}{Value}.  Values are encoded as in the encode option
described above.
	\item [\arg{List}]
Emit SGML multi-valued attributes (e.g., \const{NAMES}).  Each value in
list is separated by a space.  This is particularly useful for setting
multiple \const{class} attributes on an element.  For example:

\begin{code}
	...
	span(class([c1,c2]), ...),
\end{code}
\end{itemlist}

The example below generates a   URL  that references the predicate
set_lang/1 in the application with given parameters.  The http_handler/3
declaration binds \const{/setlang} to the predicate set_lang/1 for which
we provide a very simple implementation.  The code between \const{...}
is part of an HTML page showing the english flag which, when pressed,
calls \term{set_lang}{Request} where \arg{Request} contains the search
parameter \mbox{\const{lang} = \const{en}}.  Note that the HTTP location
(path) \const{/setlang} can be moved without affecting this code.

\begin{code}
:- http_handler('/setlang', set_lang, []).

set_lang(Request) :-
	http_parameters(Request,
			[ lang(Lang, [])
			]),
	http_session_retractall(lang(_)),
	http_session_assert(lang(Lang)),
	reply_html_page(title('Switched language'),
			p(['Switch language to ', Lang])).


	...
	html(a(href(location_by_id(set_lang) + [lang(en)]),
	       img(src('/www/images/flags/en.png')))),
	...
\end{code}



\end{itemlist}

    \dcg{page}{2}{:HeadContent, :BodyContent}
The DCG non-terminal page//2 generated a complete page, including the SGML
\const{DOCTYPE} declaration. \arg{HeadContent} are elements to be placed
in the \elem{head} element and \arg{BodyContent} are elements to be
placed in the \elem{body} element.

To achieve common style (background, page header and footer), it is
possible to define DCG non-terminals head//1 and/or body//1. Non-terminal page//1
checks for the definition of these non-terminals in the module it is called
from as well as in the \const{user} module. If no definition is found, it
creates a head with only the \arg{HeadContent} (note that the
\elem{title} is obligatory) and a \elem{body} with \const{bgcolor} set
to \const{white} and the provided \arg{BodyContent}.

Note that further customisation is easily achieved using html//1 directly
as page//2 is (besides handling the hooks) defined as:

\begin{code}
page(Head, Body) -->
	html([ \['<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 4.0//EN">\n'],
	       html([ head(Head),
		      body(bgcolor(white), Body)
		    ])
	     ]).
\end{code}

    \dcg{page}{1}{:Contents}
This version of the page/[1,2] only gives you the SGML \const{DOCTYPE}
and the \elem{HTML} element. \arg{Contents} is used to generate both the
head and body of the page.

    \dcg{html_begin}{1}{+Begin}
Just open the given element.  \arg{Begin} is either an atom or a
compound term,  In the latter case the arguments are used as arguments
to the begin-tag.  Some examples:

\begin{code}
	html_begin(table)
	html_begin(table(border(2), align(center)))
\end{code}

This predicate provides an alternative to using the
\bsl\arg{Command} syntax in the html//1 specification. The
following two fragments are the same. The preferred solution depends on
your preferences as well as whether the specification is generated or
entered by the programmer.

\begin{code}
table(Rows) -->
	html(table([border(1), align(center), width('80%')],
		   [ \table_header,
		     \table_rows(Rows)
		   ])).

% or

table(Rows) -->
	html_begin(table(border(1), align(center), width('80%'))),
	table_header,
	table_rows,
	html_end(table).
\end{code}

    \dcg{html_end}{1}{+End}
End an element.  See html_begin/1 for details.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Emitting HTML documents}
\label{sec:html-write}

The non-terminal html//1 translates a specification into a list of
atoms and layout instructions. Currently the layout instructions are
terms of the format \term{nl}{N}, requesting at least \arg{N}
newlines. Multiple consecutive \term{nl}{1} terms are combined to an
atom containing the maximum of the requested number of newline
characters.

To simplify handing the data to a client or storing it into a file,
the following predicates are available from this library:

\begin{description}
    \predicate{reply_html_page}{2}{:Head, :Body}
Same as \term{reply_html_page}{default, Head, Body}.

    \predicate{reply_html_page}{3}{+Style, :Head, :Body}
Writes an HTML page preceded by an HTTP header as required
by \pllib{http_wrapper} (CGI-style).  Here is a simple typical
example:

\begin{code}
reply(Request) :-
	reply_html_page(title('Welcome'),
			[ h1('Welcome'),
			  p('Welcome to our ...')
			]).
\end{code}

The header and footer of the page can be hooked using the grammar-rules
user:head//2 and user:body//2. The first argument passed to these hooks
is the \arg{Style} argument of reply_html_page/3 and the second is the
2nd (for head//2) or 3rd (for body//2) argument of reply_html_page/3.
These hooks can be used to restyle the page, typically by embedding the
real body content in a \elem{div}. E.g., the following code provides a
menu on top of each page of that is identified using the style
\textit{myapp}.

\begin{code}
:- multifile
	user:body//2.

user:body(myapp, Body) -->
	html(body([ div(id(top), \application_menu),
		    div(id(content), Body)
		  ])).
\end{code}

Redefining the \elem{head} can be used to pull in scripts, but
typically html_requires//1 provides a more modular approach for
pulling scripts and CSS-files.

    \predicate{print_html}{1}{+List}
Print the token list to the Prolog current output stream.

    \predicate{print_html}{2}{+Stream, +List}
Print the token list to the specified output stream

    \predicate{html_print_length}{2}{+List, -Length}
When calling html_print/[1,2] on \arg{List}, \arg{Length}
characters will be produced.  Knowing the length is needed to
provide the \const{Content-length} field of an HTTP reply-header.
\end{description}


\input{post.tex}

\subsubsection{Adding rules for html//1}
\label{sec:html-write-rules}

In some cases it is practical to extend the translations imposed by
html//1. We used this technique to define translation rules for the
output of the SWI-Prolog \pllib{sgml} package.

The html//1 non-terminal first calls the multifile ruleset html_write:expand//1.

\begin{description}
    \dcg{html_write:expand}{1}{+Spec} Hook to add additional
translation rules for html//1.

    \dcg{html_quoted}{1}{+Atom} Emit the text
in \arg{Atom}, inserting entity-references for the SGML special
characters \verb$<&>$.

    \dcg{html_quoted_attribute}{1}{+Atom} Emit the
text in \arg{Atom} suitable for use as an SGML attribute, inserting
entity-references for the SGML special characters \verb$<&>"$.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Generating layout}		\label{sec:htmllayout}

Though not strictly necessary, the library attempts to generate
reasonable layout in SGML output. It does this only by inserting
newlines before and after tags. It does this on the basis of the
multifile predicate html_write:layout/3

\begin{description}
    \predicate{html_write:layout}{3}{+Tag, -Open, -Close}
Specify the layout conventions for the element \arg{Tag}, which is a
lowercase atom. \arg{Open} is a term \arg{Pre}-\arg{Post}. It defines
that the element should have at least \arg{Pre} newline characters
before and \arg{Post} after the tag. The \arg{Close} specification is
similar, but in addition allows for the atom \const{-}, requesting the
output generator to omit the close-tag altogether or \const{empty},
telling the library that the element has declared empty content. In this
case the close-tag is not emitted either, but in addition html//1
interprets \arg{Arg} in \term{Tag}{Arg} as a list of attributes rather
than the content.

A tag that does not appear in this table is emitted without additional
layout. See also print_html/[1,2]. Please consult the
library source for examples.
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Examples for using the HTML write library}
\label{sec:html-write-examples}

In the following example we will generate a table of Prolog predicates
we find from the SWI-Prolog help system based on a keyword. The primary
database is defined by the predicate predicate/5 We will make hyperlinks
for the predicates pointing to their documentation.

\begin{code}
html_apropos(Kwd) :-
	findall(Pred, apropos_predicate(Kwd, Pred), Matches),
	phrase(apropos_page(Kwd, Matches), Tokens),
	print_html(Tokens).

%	emit page with title, header and table of matches

apropos_page(Kwd, Matches) -->
	page([ title(['Predicates for ', Kwd])
	     ],
	     [ h2(align(center),
		  ['Predicates for ', Kwd]),
	       table([ align(center),
		       border(1),
		       width('80%')
		     ],
		     [ tr([ th('Predicate'),
			    th('Summary')
			  ])
		     | \apropos_rows(Matches)
		     ])
	     ]).

%	emit the rows for the body of the table.

\subsubsection{Remarks on the \pllib{http/html_write} library}
\label{sec:html-write-remarks}

This library is the result of various attempts to reach at a more
satisfactory and Prolog-minded way to produce HTML text from a program.
We have been using Prolog for the generation of web pages in a number of
projects. Just using format/2 never was not a real option, generating
error-prone HTML from clumsy syntax. We started with a layer on top of
format/2, keeping track of the current nesting and thus always capable
of properly closing the environment.

DCG based translation however, naturally exploits Prolog's
term-rewriting primitives. If generation fails for whatever reason it is
easy to produce an alternative document (for example holding an error
message).

In a future version we will probably define a goal_expansion/2 to do
compile-time optimisation of the library. Quotation of known text and
invocation of sub-rules using the \bsl\arg{RuleSet} and
<Module>:<RuleSet> operators are costly operations in the analysis
that can be done at compile-time.

\section{Transfer encodings}
\label{sec:transfer}

\index{chunked,encoding}%
\index{deflate,encoding}%
The HTTP protocol provides for \jargon{transfer encodings}. These define
filters applied to the data described by the \const{Content-type}. The
two most popular transfer encodings are \const{chunked} and
\const{deflate}. The \const{chunked} encoding avoids the need for
a \const{Content-length} header, sending the data in chunks, each of
which is preceded by a length.  The \const{deflate} encoding provides
compression.

Transfer-encodings are supported by filters defined as foreign libraries
that realise an encoding/decoding stream on top of another stream.
Currently there are two such libraries: \pllib{http/http_chunked.pl}
and \pllib{zlib.pl}.

There is an emerging hook interface dealing with transfer encodings. The
\pllib{http/http_chunked.pl} provides a hook used by
\pllib{http/http_open.pl} to support chunked encoding in http_open/3.
Note that both \file{http_open.pl} \emph{and} \file{http_chunked.pl}
must be loaded for http_open/3 to support chunked encoding.

\subsection{The \pllib{http/http_chunked} library}
\label{sec:http-chunked}

\begin{description}
    \predicate{http_chunked_open}{3}{+RawStream, -DataStream, +Options}
Create a stream to realise HTTP chunked encoding or decoding. The
technique is similar to library(zlib), using a Prolog stream as a filter
on another stream.  See online documentation at
\url{http://www.swi-prolog.org/} for details.

\section{Security}
\label{sec:http-security}

Writing servers is an inherently dangerous job that should be carried out
with some considerations. You have basically started a program on a
public terminal and invited strangers to use it. When using the
interactive server or inetd based server the server runs under your
privileges. Using CGI scripted it runs with the privileges of your
web-server. Though it should not be possible to fatally compromise a
Unix machine using user privileges, getting unconstrained access to the
system is highly undesirable.

Symbolic languages have an additional handicap in their inherent
possibilities to modify the running program and dynamically create goals
(this also applies to the popular Perl and PHP scripting languages).
Here are some guidelines.

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [Check your input]
Hardly anything can go wrong if you check the validity of
query-arguments before formulating an answer.

    \item [Check filenames]
If part of the query consists of filenames or directories, check them.
This also applies to files you only read. Passing names as
\file{/etc/passwd}, but also \file{../../../../../etc/passwd} are tried
by hackers to learn about the system they want to attack. So, expand
provided names using absolute_file_name/[2,3] and verify they are inside
a folder reserved for the server. Avoid symbolic links from this subtree
to the outside world. The example below checks validity of filenames.
The first call ensures proper canonisation of the paths to avoid an
mismatch due to symbolic links or other filesystem ambiguities.

\begin{code}
check_file(File) :-
	absolute_file_name('/path/to/reserved/area', Reserved),
	absolute_file_name(File, Tried),
	sub_atom(Tried, 0, _, _, Reserved).
\end{code}

    \item [Check scripts]
Should input in any way activate external scripts using shell/1 or
\exam{open(pipe(Command), ...)}, verify the argument once more. Use
process_create/3 in preference over shell/1 as this function avoids
stringification of arguments (Unix) or ensures proper quoting of
arguments (Windows).

    \item [Check meta-calling]
\emph{The} attractive situation for you and your attacker is below:

\begin{code}
reply(Query) :-
	member(search(Args), Query),
	member(action=Action, Query),
	member(arg=Arg, Query),
	call(Action, Arg).		% NEVER EVER DO THIS!
\end{code}

All your attacker has to do is specify \arg{Action} as \const{shell}
and \arg{Arg} as \const{/bin/sh} and he has an uncontrolled shell!
\end{itemlist}


\section{Tips and tricks}
\label{sec:http-tips-and-tricks}

\begin{itemlist}
    \item [URL Locations]
With an application in mind, it is tempting to make all URL
locations short and directly connected to the root (\const{/}). This is
\emph{not} a good idea. It is adviced to have all locations in a server
below a directory with an informative name. Consider to make the root
location something that can be changed using a global setting.

    \begin{itemize}
	\item Page generating code can easily be reused.  Using locations
	      directly below the root however increases the likelihood
	      of conflicts.
	\item Multiple servers can be placed behind the same public
	      server as explained in \secref{proxy}.  Using a common
	      and fairly unique root, redirection is much easier and
	      less likely to lead to conflicts.
    \end{itemize}

    \item [Debugging]
Debugging multi-threaded applications is possible using the graphical
debugger. This implies requires that the xpce extension package must be
installed.  Spy-points may be placed using tspy/1.
\end{itemlist}

\section{Status}
\label{sec:http-status}

The SWI-Prolog HTTP library is in active use in a large number of
projects. It is considered one of the SWI-Prolog core libraries that is
actively maintained and regularly extended with new features. This is
particularly true for the multi-threaded server. The inetd based server
may be applicable for infrequent requests where the startup time is less
relevant.  The XPCE based server is considered obsolete.

This library is by no means complete and you are free to extend it.
